# docker-appcelerator-ci

A Dockerfile to build, install dependancies and allow jasmine unit tests to run for a Titanium application.

Work in progress. You can view more about this image and the reasoning behind it at [https://dor.ky/continuous-integration-testing-an-appcelerator-titanium-mobile-application/](https://dor.ky/continuous-integration-testing-an-appcelerator-titanium-mobile-application/) and ideas, suggestions and PR's are most welcome.

Many thanks go to both [Rene Pot](https://github.com/topener) for my persistant questioning and to [Adam Paxton](https://github.com/adampax) who helped a lot with workarounds and ideas.
